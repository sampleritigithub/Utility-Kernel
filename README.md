# Utility-Kernel
# The Utility Kernel is a great program which can help you in:

  1. Centralizing Your Code
  2. Stabilizing Your Code
  3. Making Your Code More Efficient and Compact

# How to use the Kernel:

  **Intro**: The Kernel is a program with two blocks (classes). _System_, and _Process_. By default, the program will set up a _System_ class ready for production. Also by default, the program will look for _Kernel Scripts_ in the _Programs_ directory. 
  
  **Kernel Scripts**: _Kernel Scripting_ is a scripting language which is straight-forward for any python programmer--**but the only problem is the command set (the functions) is low.**
  
  **How to write Kernel Scripts**: There are _5_ main commands in the interface: 

  No. 1 is _print_: You just write _print_, space, and the thing you want to write [Example: print Test]. You could also use the dollar sign ($) to indicate a variable [Example: print $testVariable]. 

  No. 2 is _promptuser_: It just asks the user for a python line to execute.

  No. 3 is _writefile_: It just writes a file [Example: writefile filename data1].

  No 4. is _readfile_: It just reads a file [Example: readfile filename].

  No 5. is _sayvars_: It just prints all the variables.

  **NOTE: You could write variables like: [testvar = testval]. You could also do math operations.**
